# SPOILER ALERT!

Don't spoil it! Hide copy and images with a bit of SVG blur. Hint on mouseover. Reveal on click.
Do you publish spoilers? Do you wish you could have them on your page in a way that wasn't fucking rude? With Spoiler Alert! you can! Hide spoilers with a bit of blur.

## Usage

To make your site spoiler free, simply include spoiler.js, then, add this somewhere:

```javascript
$('spoiler, .spoiler').spoilerAlert()
```

To control the maximum and partial blurs, you can pass arguments:

```javascript
$('spoiler, .spoiler').spoilerAlert({max: 10, partial: 4})
```

Have fun! Play with it! (but don't go over 10 .. this plugin explicitly does not go to 11)
